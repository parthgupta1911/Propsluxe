# Propsluxe: Real Estate on Blockchain

Welcome to Propsluxe, an innovative platform that revolutionizes the real estate market by leveraging the power of the Ethereum blockchain. Propsluxe is a fullstack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project that transforms traditional property transactions into secure, transparent, and efficient digital processes.

## Features

- **NFT Property Representation**: Properties are minted as unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a secure and immutable record of ownership.
- **Buy, Sell, and Mint Properties**: Users can easily mint new property NFTs, list them for sale, or purchase existing properties directly through the platform.
- **Two-Layer Verification System**: Ensures the legitimacy and legal compliance of property transactions with a robust verification process involving both government bodies and platform administrators.

## How It Works

1. **Mint Property NFTs**: Property owners can mint NFTs representing their real estate, converting physical assets into digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Marketplace**: Browse and list property NFTs in a user-friendly marketplace. Buyers and sellers can easily connect, negotiate, and transact.
3. **Verification**: Each property undergoes a two-layer verification process for added security and compliance, involving both governmental and administrative review.
